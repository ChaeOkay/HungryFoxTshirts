      t-shirts live on from the early 80's. You remember the hits:

      %b THE GOODS
      All t-shirts were fabricated in the 80's, and have been neatly stocked away for 20 years. None of the shirts have been worn, and are in mint condition.

      %b WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?
      When my in-laws were studying at Cornell in the 70's, they would sell rock t-shirts outside of music venues on the weekends. After graduation, they started a mail-order t-shirt company called 'On Top', one of the first of its kind. Sadly, they didn't transition into e-commerce. But luckily for you, they have an impressive inventory of merchandise left over.
